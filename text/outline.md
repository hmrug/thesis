## Mechanics of collateral
Before the Global Financial Crisis there were no frictions in the money markets. Money markets were boring, which was good. There was a zoo of liquidity that consisted of private sector liquidity (comercial papers, MBS etc.), public sector liquidity (Treasury collateral) and central bank liquidity (reserves). Now we have only two of those and have to balance their volume. Singh money and collateral.
